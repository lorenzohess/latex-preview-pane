* TO DO [1/6]
- [X] go through entire package and add comments, docstrings, good formatting, NOTEs and TODOs
- [ ] explain how package works (use prose and diagram to show control flow)
- [ ] figure out if package works well enough to refactor or if there's a better design that needs a new package

If doing refactor:
- [ ] go through pull requests and forks and merge good suggestions
- [ ] standardize package prefix (probably lpp)
- [ ] add =let= statements to make some long oneliners (e.g. with regexps) more clear
* Changes so far
1. Added docstring and inline comments to everything in =latex-preview-pane.el=.
